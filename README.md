# Transcribe 

Transcribe is a Flask server that uses a combination of FFMpeg, yt-dlp (a fork of youtube-dl), and Whisper.cpp to  create a transcription of audio (wav,mp3, etc), video(mp4, mkv, etc) and YouTube videos.

The transcription can be viewed and listened to  within a generated webpage, and for YouTube vidoes a side-by-side player is shown. The playback is matched to the transcription (see screenshots).
